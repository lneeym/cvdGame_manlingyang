# 🎮 Twin Pupils: Color Perception Puzzles
A puzzle game where your colorblindness isn't a bug—it's a feature.

**"What if being colorblind was your superpower, not your kryptonite?"**

In Twin Pupils, you're a secret agent whose vision flickers between normal and colorblind. Trapped in prison, that 'fresh' meal everyone sees? It's actually rotten—but only your colorblind vision reveals the truth. Blinding interrogation lights that break others? You see right through them.

The first puzzle game where your 'disability' is your greatest ability."

## What's This About?

Hey there! Welcome to Twin Pupils, a puzzle game that flips the script on visual "disabilities." 

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🌈 Why This Game Exists

Real talk: About 300 million people worldwide have color vision deficiency (CVD). Most games either ignore them or treat colorblindness as a difficulty setting. We wanted to make something different—a game where being colorblind makes you special, not disadvantaged.

This started as a graduate school project exploring empathy through game design. It evolved into something we hope makes both colorblind and non-colorblind players think differently about perception and ability.

## 🎨 For Colorblind Players

Hey, we made this for you too! While the game is about experiencing both perspectives, we've made sure:
- All crucial information has non-color indicators
- UI elements use symbols alongside colors
- You can totally play this even if you're colorblind IRL


## 📝 Research & Credits

This game is based on real research with the CVD community:
- Interviews with colorblind individuals and their families
- Medical consultation on color vision science
- Gameplay testing with both CVD and non-CVD players

Special thanks to the 3 colorblind gamers who shared their stories and tested our early builds. You know who you are. 💙


## 🎮 One Last Thing

Remember: In Twin Pupils, what others call a weakness might just be your strength. Sometimes seeing less lets you see more.

Happy puzzling! 🧩
